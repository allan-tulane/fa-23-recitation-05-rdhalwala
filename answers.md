If every character had the same frequency, and the frequency is the same amount, and the length of the alphabet is the same, then the encoding would be the same. To calculate it it is length of Sigma*f*log2Sigma +1. This is consistent across documents because it doesn't matter what the content of he alphabet is as long as the frequency is the same.
